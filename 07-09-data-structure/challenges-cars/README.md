# Bite 21. Query a nested data structure

Given the provided cars dictionary:

Get all Jeeps
Get the first car of every manufacturer.
Get all vehicles containing the string Trail in their names (should work for other grep too)
Sort the models (values) alphabetically
See the docstrings and tests for more details. Have fun!

Update 18th of Sept 2018: as concluded in the forum it is better to pass the cars dict into each function to make its scope local.
